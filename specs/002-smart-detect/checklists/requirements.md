# Specification Quality Checklist: Reliable Batch Smart Page-Order Detect

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-25
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation iteration 1 (2026-07-25): All items pass. Spec allows completing or replacing the prior incomplete detector so long as reliability criteria hold; algorithm choice deferred to `/speckit-plan`.
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers; defaults documented in Assumptions (batch-only scope, name-hint precedence, even-default on ties, experimental batch label retained).
- Ready for `/speckit-clarify` (optional) or `/speckit-plan`.
